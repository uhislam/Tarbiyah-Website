According to past experience, It is immensly difficult to manage all aspects of a web app at the same time. Thus a strategic plan of action is required.

First, I will determine the purpose and features of the app

The goal is to base the HTML in a databse rather than real HTML. This will allow for the creation of a dynamic app that doesn't require me.

The purpose is to build a small website and community around Br. Younoos's book and make $5K by presenting a mockup to Br Younoos on Friday. 

It first of all needs to host the book.
It second of all needs to allow for next content to be constantly generated and third for a discussion to naturally follow

Don't build too much infastructure. I beleive that immensely. Don't you dare. Build a simple website that is static, based on the duplicated database, and does the freaking job. Later you can make new updates. I agree with that. THis will already take ten hours dumbass.
