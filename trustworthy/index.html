                    <span style="font-weight: 700;"> A Scout is friendly. Be a friend to everyone, even people
                    who are very different from you. A Scout is a friend to
                    all other scouts. A Scout offers friendship to people of all
                    races, religions, and nations, and a Scout respects them
                    even if their beliefs and customs are different. </span> (The Scout
                    Handbook)<br> <br>
                    Muslims should treat everyone equally and befriend everyone
                    regardless of race and ethnicity, and this can be witnessed
                    during the Hajj when all men wear a white cloth regardless of
                    race or status. The Muslim is friendly and neighborly towards
                    people of all religions, respecting their houses of worship and
                    joining hands with them in good causes. <br> <br>
                    Allah is Al-Lateef, the Gentle and Benevolent. He knows our
                    thoughts and emotions and deals with us gently through kind,
                    subtle, and friendly ways. When we recognize how Al-Lateef
                    treats us with so much gentleness, that should make us want
                    to be a source of friendliness and kindness to others as a way
                    of being grateful to Him. </p>
